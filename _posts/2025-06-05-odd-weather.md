# Sunny in St. John's

## Summer has come early

Not sure what we did to deserve this, but usually May and June in Newfoundland can be chilly. 

This is due to a combination of factors:

### Cold Sea Temperatures:
The Labrador Current, a cold current flowing southward from the Arctic, significantly chills the surrounding waters, impacting coastal temperatures. 

### Prevailing Winds:
Strong northerly and northwesterly winds, sometimes following storms, can bring in Arctic air, causing temperatures to plummet. 
Influence of the Arctic:
Newfoundland's location, relatively close to the Arctic, means it's prone to experiencing cold air masses even during spring and early summer. 

### Spring Snowfall:
Occasionally, bouts of wintry precipitation, including snow, can occur until at least mid-May in most years, and even into early June in some areas. 

### Summer Variability:
While summer temperatures generally rise, Newfoundland can still experience cool days and even fog, especially along the southern coast due to prevailing southwest winds chilled by the ocean. 
In summary, the combination of the cold Labrador Current, prevailing wind patterns, and proximity to the Arctic results in a cooler-than-expected climate in Newfoundland and Labrador during May and June.
