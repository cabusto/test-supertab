# Toronto Raptors 2024-25 Season: A Challenging Year

Looking back at the completed 2024-25 NBA season, it's time to reflect on how the Toronto Raptors performed. Unfortunately, this wasn't the triumphant season that Raptors fans were hoping for.

## Season Record and Standings

The Raptors finished the season with a **30-52 record**, placing them 3rd out of 5 teams in the Atlantic Division and 11th in the Eastern Conference. This meant the team missed the playoffs for another year, a disappointing outcome for a franchise that has historically been competitive in the Eastern Conference.

## Team Performance Analysis

The statistics paint a picture of a team that struggled on both ends of the floor:

- **Points per game:** 110.9 (ranked 23rd out of 30 NBA teams)
- **Opponent points per game:** 115.2 (18th out of 30)
- **Net rating:** -4.3 (24th in the league)
- **Offensive rating:** 110.5 (25th)
- **Defensive rating:** 114.8 (17th)

The team averaged 43.8 rebounds and 28.7 assists per game, with a field goal percentage of 46.6% and three-point percentage of 34.9%. While the defense showed some promise with a middle-of-the-pack ranking, the offense clearly struggled to generate consistent scoring.

## Bright Spots: Individual Performances

Despite the team's struggles, several players showed promise and gave fans reasons to be optimistic about the future:

### RJ Barrett
The standout performer of the season, Barrett led the team with **21.1 points per game** on 46.8% shooting from the field and 35.0% from three-point range. His emergence as a primary scorer after joining from the Knicks has been one of the few bright spots.

### Scottie Barnes
The young star continued his development with **19.3 points, 7.7 rebounds, and 5.8 assists per game**. Barnes remains the cornerstone of the franchise's future and showed improvement in multiple areas of his game.

### Supporting Cast
- **Jakob Poeltl:** Anchored the defense with 9.6 rebounds and 1.2 blocks per game
- **Immanuel Quickley:** Contributed 17.1 points and 5.8 assists per game, providing valuable playmaking
- **Gradey Dick and Chris Boucher:** Both players made steady contributions throughout the season

## Season Challenges

The Raptors faced significant obstacles throughout the year:

1. **Long Losing Streaks:** The team endured extended losing stretches, particularly during December and January, which effectively ended their playoff hopes early.

2. **Offensive Struggles:** Ranked 25th in offensive rating, the Raptors consistently had trouble putting points on the board.

3. **Consistency Issues:** The team struggled to string together wins, failing to build any meaningful momentum.

## Looking Ahead

While the 2024-25 season was undoubtedly disappointing, there are reasons for optimism. The team has a young core led by Scottie Barnes and RJ Barrett, both of whom are still developing. The front office will likely be active in the offseason, looking to add pieces that can complement their young stars and return the Raptors to playoff contention.

The focus now shifts to player development, potential roster changes, and building a team that can compete in an increasingly competitive Eastern Conference. Raptors fans are hoping that this difficult season will serve as a learning experience and a stepping stone to future success.

**We The North** – and we'll be back stronger next season!
